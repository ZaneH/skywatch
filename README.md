# ⛅️ SkyWatch

A METAR decoder. Written in SwiftUI.

**In development.**

- METAR data is from [beta.aviationweather.gov](https://beta.aviationweather.gov/).
- Station data is from [aviationweather.gov/dataserver](https://www.aviationweather.gov/dataserver/example?datatype=station).

Tested on iPad and macOS.

## Todo

- [ ] Link to AWC map (example: [KJFK](https://beta.aviationweather.gov/gfa/?tab=obs&basemap=esriDark&mapLayers=basicMap,boundary&center=40.63,%20-73.77&zoom=12&boundarytype=gairmet))
- [ ] Add preference for °C/°F units
- [ ] Add TAF info
- [ ] Add NOTAM info
- [ ] Optimize app to hold more stations
  - Currently, loading every station causes lag
